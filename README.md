# Luis-Navarro-Python-Fundamentals-Project
Project for Fundamentals of Data Analysis as part of Higher Diploma in Data Analytics - GMIT

## Description:
This project is an investigation regarding the boxplot graphical representation through a serie of features:
- History and context
- Characteristics
- Use of boxplot
- Interpretation of boxplots though an example
- Evolution and alternatives to boxplot

## Usage
To run this code, please use the Jupyter Notebook file under the name Boxplot analysis.ipynb in this repository.

Jupyter Notebook can be initiated through Anaconda Navigator and it will use your browser to deploy both texts an code, as it includes an interpreter.

All code included in this project is Python 3.6.4. Additional packages needed to run this code are matplotlib and Pandas.

These packages can be individually downloaded and installed as per instructions available in their documentation. However, dowloading an installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) will ensure full compatibility for Linux, Mac and Windows systems.
